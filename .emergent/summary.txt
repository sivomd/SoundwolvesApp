**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - **Issue 1:** The live chat button had a  animation that made it difficult to click. The agent removed the animation as a fix. A more subtle, non-intrusive animation could be implemented as a refinement.
     - **Debug checklist:** Check  and replace the removed  class with a more suitable hover or pulse animation from Tailwind CSS.
     - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** To improve user experience by making the chat button easily clickable while still drawing attention to it.
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Frontend
     - **Is recurring issue?** N

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - No previous forks.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, React Router DOM
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a custom, token-based design system (in ).
- **UI Components:** Utilizes the shadcn/ui component library.
- **State Management:**  and  hooks for local component state, with  for persisting mock data like user sessions and created profiles.
- **Prototyping:** The application is a high-fidelity frontend prototype with no live backend. All data is hardcoded or stored in the browser.

**key DB schema**
- N/A (No database is connected; all data is mocked in the frontend).

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
- : Critical file defining the entire application's design system, including colors, fonts, and custom properties.
- : Configures Tailwind CSS to consume the design tokens from .
- : The main application entry point that defines all routes using React Router.
- , , : These files contain the hardcoded mock data for events and DJs.
- , , : Documentation files outlining project setup, deployment, and future work.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **Data Centralization:** The mock data for DJs and events is duplicated across several components (, , ). This should be refactored into a single source of truth, such as , to improve maintainability and avoid inconsistencies.

**key api endpoints**
- N/A. The application is a frontend-only prototype.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- This is a **frontend-only prototype**. Do not attempt to connect to a backend or database. All dynamic functionality is simulated using React state and .
- Adherence to the established design system in  is mandatory. Use the defined CSS variables for all styling; do not hardcode colors or styles.
- The user is very specific about branding. The current logo and video assets are hardcoded and should be used unless the user provides new ones.

3. **User (Data):** Provided specific Instagram links for DJs and requested event dates be moved to 2025/2026. (Completed)
**Pending:** The agent has fulfilled the last request and is now awaiting user feedback and verification.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** None.
- **Mocked:** The entire application's data and dynamic functionality is mocked, including:
    - User Authentication (Login/Logout)
    - DJ Profile Creation & Management
    - Event & DJ data, search, and filtering
    - Following DJs, booking tickets, sharing links
    - Live Chat interactions

- None.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** None.
- **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
- No credentials needed. On the login page, any text can be entered in the email and password fields to simulate a successful login.

**What agent forgot to execute**
- **Centralize Mock Data:** The agent did not refactor the duplicated mock data for events and DJs into a single, centralized file. The data is currently hardcoded in multiple page components, making it difficult to maintain.</analysis>
